# About Me
Jackson Smith
he/him/his

I am currently in my second year of the Master of Arts Management program and expect to graduate in May 2021. Before coming to the program, I earned my Bachelor's degree at the University of Colorado - Boulder in Finance and Theatre. Following graduation from CU, I moved back home to Minnesota and got a job working as a theatre company for about 4 years.
After graduating from CMU, I am hoping to work my way towards being a Managing Director for a theatre company. I want to bring my love of numbers and love of theatre together to help an organization survive and thrive.

# What I Hope to Learn
Over my career, I have become very familiar with using Excel to analyze and visualize data. I know that this is not neccesarily the best option for visualizing data in clear manners with more than one or two colors (especially after completing my Systems Synthesis project last semester). Through this class, I am hoping to learn other options to create visualizations. This is important to my career because a big part of working in a non-profit is being able to communicate the progress made on your mission to both funders and patrons. Most theatre companies are non-profits, so I believe that understanding good visualizations will be important for me in my future endeavors.
